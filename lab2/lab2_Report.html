        <h3>What is your element CSS class?</h3>
        <p>I used multiple element CSS classes. One of them is <code>#table .pic</code> which was used to style the pictures which are inside the table</p>

        <h3>What is your global CSS class?</h3>
        <p>I used multiple global CSS classes. One of them is <code>#buttons</code> which was used to style the links to appear as buttons</p>

        <h3>What are your HTML5-only tags?</h3>
        <p>The HTML-5 tags I used were <code>header</code> , and <code>footer</code> tags</p>

        <h3>What are your CSS3-only features?</h3>
        <p>I used the linear-gradient CSS3 feature to create a background with a slight gradient of two different shades of blue from left 
            to right using: <code> background: linear-gradient(to left, #0083B0, #00B4DB);</code> The other CSS3 only feature I used was 
            <code>box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.384);</code> which was used to create a shadow around the login div
        </p>

        <h3>Did you use the same protection method? If no, what did you use this time?</h3>
        <p>Yes, I used the same protection method as lab 1 with hiding and unhiding elements with javascript.</p>
        
        <h3>How long did you spend on this lab?</h3>
        <p>This lab didn't take long. The lab aproximately took 1 - 2 hours.</p>
